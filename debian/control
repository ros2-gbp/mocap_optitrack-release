Description: Streaming of OptiTrack mocap data to tf This package contains a node that translates motion capture data from an OptiTrack rig to tf transforms, poses and 2D poses.
 The node receives packets that are streamed by a NatNet compliant source, decodes them and broadcasts the poses of configured rigid bodies as tf transforms, poses, and/or 2D poses. Currently, this node supports the NatNet streaming protocol v3.0 Copyright (c) 2013, Clearpath Robotics Copyright (c) 2010, University of Bonn, Computer Science Institute VI All rights reserved.
