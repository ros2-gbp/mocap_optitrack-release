ros-humble-mocap-optitrack (1.0.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Feat: implement ros1 features and fixes
  * Removed wrong and undesired transformation
  * Implemented optitrack timestamp
    The message timestamp will now be the time at which optitrack acquired the data instead of the time at which the ROS node received the data
  * Fixed deprecated parameters
  * Allowed undeclared parameters
  * Port to ROS2
  * Natnet and server version can now be set in config file
    Added a way to set both natnet and server version from yaml file, so you don't have to restart the broadcast each time you launch the mocap node. Add "version: [3,0,0,0]" in the optitrack_config-part of the config file
  * Updates all source files with BSD license blurb.
    Also removes std_msgs has a build dependency as its not a dependency in
    the code anywhere. Cleans up package.xml to format 2, adds all authors, and
    corrects maintainer.
  * Adds 2nd body to example config file
    Also removes use_new_coordinates from the example config file. This is now calculated internally from the server version.
  * Removes console output from launch file
  * Completes refactoring. Tested with NatNet version 3.
  * Finishes a majority of the refactoring and verifies it works for NatNet version 3.0
  * Heavily refactors code to improve compatibility with NatNet SDK and improve single responsibility.
  * Debugging NatNet version 3.0..
  * Added version checking to allow for support for changes related to
    certain NatNet versions.
  * Added support for new (Motive 1.7+) and old coordinate system.
  * updated for recent natnet protocol
  * Removed un-needed code.
  * Turned down verbosity for less spam when output=screen.
  * mocap configuration file is an option to launch file.
  * Optitrack multicast address is now a parameter in the config file.
  * Fixed config parameter name in example configuration file.
    frame_id -> child_frame_id: The latter is used in mocap_config.cpp (CHILD_FRAME_ID_PARAM_NAME)
  * Removed tabs from launch file.
  * Switched to a pose stamped message.  Added parameters for parent and child frames.
  * initial2
  * initial
  * Update socket.h
    fixed a typo
  * Install the config directory as well, and add a roslaunch file check macro for the launch file to prevent a regression.
  * Updated package.xml and cleaned up CMakeLists.txt
  * Split off src portion of CMakeLists.
  * Lowercase filenames for socket, remove separate exception header, move headers into package subdirectory.
  * Tested with actual system and deleted unneeded old files.
  * Tried to convert to catkin.
  * Tried to convert to catkin.
  * Updated copyright & authors in manifest.xml.
  * Cleaned up sample configuration file.
  * Updated supported NatNet protocol and description.
  * Added missing stack dependencies.
  * Converted to a unary stack.
    Added stack.xml to make this a unary stack. Also fixed missing include
    for ROS_DEBUG.
  * Squashing for release
  * Some commenting to yaml config file
  * Fixed pose streaming for NaN values.
  * Tweaking configs

    Changes to be committed:
    (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    modified:   mocap_optitrack/config/mocap.yaml
    modified:   mocap_optitrack/src/mocap_config.cpp
  * Fixed inversion in published TF.
  * Renamed parameters to reflect the fact that tf will always be published to the same topic.
  * Fixed loop and termination code to handle SIGINT correctly.
  * Added some headers & comments.
  * Fix conversion from OptiTrack to ROS coordinate system.
  * Check for all zeros in data. This occurs when the object is not
    being tracked by Optitrack. Zero data should not result in any
    pose/tf being published in ROS.
  * Simplified conversion from Optitrack to Pose2D.
  * Cleanup and fixed uninitialized variable problems. Node now works
    consistently, since variables are initialized as expected.
  * Some cleanup and prepare for correct mocap->ROS data conversion.
  * Implemented multi-object support. Each object may be exposed as a
    tf, Pose, or Pose2D with different topics configurable for each
    rigid body & datatype.
  * Fixed deserialization of Pose values. Code was incorrectly trying
    to read position/orientation as float64 values instead of the actual
    float that's in the packet.
  * Fixed remaining packet parsing bugs. Can now read multiple data sets from NatNet packets.
  * Cleaned up parsing a bit, but getting some garbage in output.
  * Fixed a bunch of stuff in OptiTrack packet parsing: crashes, memory leaks, some ugliness. Added Pose and Pose2D topics for using packages that may require these kinds of inputs. Added three parameters to enable/disable each of these topics: publish_transform, publish_pose, and publish_ground_pose.
  * Fixed memory allocation and parsing.
  * Don't launch the silly xterm.
